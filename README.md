This homework assignment was challenging for me to because of all of the functions that were needed in order to get the password generator to work. It took me awhile to figure out the best way to write the functions to get them to preform the way I wanted them too and for them to include all of the actions I needed. It definitely required a lot of google research to get the best understanding I could on what each function was and what I needed to complete it. While stressful it was a lot of fun to do and I'm super proud of the way this turned out.
